# Doolf Sword
It's like Half Sword. It's Doolf Sword!

CVAR - DoSo_MouseSens - Factor for all mouse movement when in one of the weapon control modes.

## Controls
+attack     - enter swing mode, both translating the weapon in x/z and rotating it.
+altattack  - enter thrust mode, only translating the weapon in x/y.
BOTH        - enter rotate mode, rotating the weapon in place.

##
things are kinda janky, maybe I'll figure out how to fix this in the next six years. make sure to swing your weapon up to a decent speed or else risk dealing zero damage and getting your weapon potentially stuck.
